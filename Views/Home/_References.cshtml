                            Mr. Krizsma has a comprehensive and very big knowledgebase, which he uses extremely
                            successful to address everyday tasks. He pursued the agreed goals sustainably and
                            with maximum success. He was hired to rebuild the existing web application, meanwhile
                            maintaining the old one. According to his best skills he helped in the data migration process
                            between the .Net and the new Python application. Even in the most stressful situations
                            he remained concentrated and calm, and focused only to solve the actual problem as soon
                            as possible. We were very satisfied with the quality and speed of his work.
                            He worked in an english and german speaking envinronment, and was a very important
                            member of our team. We wish him all the best in his future career.

                            Gyula is an excellent software engineer.
                            At netagenda he was responsible to rewrite the whole application from the ground up.
                            Besides being a technical leader of our small team, he designed and also developed the new system,
                            while he maintained the old application. He is a very reliable person, whom you can always count on.
                            He stayed every time when there was an unexpected/critical error with the old system, till it has been solved.
                            The whole team will definitely miss his straight, entertaining and very helpful attitude.

                            Gyula is a great software engineer and full stack developer in the sense that his knowledge spans from server platforms and cloud infrastructure to mv* JavaScript frameworks, with a very solid .net knowledge in between. He's methodical, and professional. Also very keen to stay up to date with the latest technologies. On top of that he has a great sense of humor while being very service minded. I hope to have the opportunity to work with him again some time.
